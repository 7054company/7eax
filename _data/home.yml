  Static sites are fast to get up and running and develop on. They are also performance
  beasts but their biggest downside is non technical users editing content. Adding the
  Netlify CMS to your Jekyll site means clients can update this site via a Web UI. It is
  no wordpress or Drupal replacement, but gets the job done.
